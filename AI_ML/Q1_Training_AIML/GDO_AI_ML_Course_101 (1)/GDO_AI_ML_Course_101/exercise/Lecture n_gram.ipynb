      "tennis is a racket sport that can be played individually against a single opponent singles or between two teams of two players each doubles. each player uses a tennis racket that is strung with cord to strike a hollow rubber ball covered with felt over or around a net and into the opponents court. the object of the game is to maneuver the ball in such a way that the opponent is not able to play a valid return. the player who is unable to return the ball will not gain a point while the opposite player will.tennis is an olympic sport and is played at all levels of society and at all ages. the sport can be played by anyone who can hold a racket including wheelchair users. the modern game of tennis originated in birmingham england in the late th century as lawn tennis. it had close connections both to various field lawn games such as croquet and bowls as well as to the older racket sport today called real tennis. during most of the th century in fact the term tennis referred to real tennis not lawn tennis.the rules of modern tennis have changed little since the s. two exceptions are that from  to  the server had to keep one foot on the ground at all times and the adoption of the tiebreak in the s. a recent addition to professional tennis has been the adoption of electronic review technology coupled with a pointchallenge system which allows a player to contest the line call of a point a system known as hawkeye.tennis is played by millions of recreational players and is also a popular worldwide spectator sport. the four grand slam tournaments also referred to as the majors are especially popular the australian open played on hard courts the french open played on red clay courts wimbledon played on grass courts and the us open also played on hard courts.historians believe that the games ancient origin lay in th century northern france where a ball was struck with the palm of the hand. louis x of france was a keen player of jeu de paume game of the palm which evolved into real tennis and became notable as the first person to construct indoor tennis courts in the modern style. louis was unhappy with playing tennis outdoors and accordingly had indoor enclosed courts made in paris around the end of the th century. in due course this design spread across royal palaces all over europe. in june  at vincennes valdemarne and following a particularly exhausting game louis drank a large quantity of cooled wine and subsequently died of either pneumonia or pleurisy although there was also suspicion of poisoning. because of the contemporary accounts of his death louis x is historys first tennis player known by name. another of the early enthusiasts of the game was king charles v of france who had a court set up at the louvre palace.it was not until the th century that rackets came into use and the game began to be called tennis from the french term tenez which can be translated as hold receive or take an interjection used as a call from the server to his opponent. it was popular in england and france although the game was only played indoors where the ball could be hit off the wall. henry viii of england was a big fan of this game which is now known as real tennis. during the th and early th centuries as real tennis declined new racket sports emerged in england.the invention of the first lawn mower in  in britain is believed to have been a catalyst for the preparation of modernstyle grass courts sporting ovals playing fields pitches greens etc. this in turn led to the codification of modern rules for many sports including lawn tennis most football codes lawn bowls and others.between  and  harry gem a solicitor and his friend augurio perera developed a game that combined elements of racquets and the basque ball game pelota which they played on pereras croquet lawn in birmingham in england. in  along with two local doctors they founded the worlds first tennis club on avenue road leamington spa. this is where lawn tennis was used as a name of activity by a club for the first time. after leamington the second club to take up the game of lawn tennis appears to have been the edgbaston archery and croquet society also in birmingham.in tennis a cultural history heiner gillmeister reveals that on december   british army officer walter clopton wingfield wrote to harry gem commenting that he wingfield had been experimenting with his version of lawn tennis for a year and a half. in december  wingfield designed and patented a game which he called sphairistik greek  meaning ballplaying and was soon known simply as sticky  for the amusement of guests at a garden party on his friends estate of nantclwyd hall in llanelidan wales. according to r. d. c. evans turfgrass agronomist sports historians all agree that wingfield deserves much of the credit for the development of modern tennis. according to honor godfrey museum curator at wimbledon wingfield popularized this game enormously. he produced a boxed set which included a net poles rackets balls for playing the game  and most importantly you had his rules. he was absolutely terrific at marketing and he sent his game all over the world. he had very good connections with the clergy the law profession and the aristocracy and he sent thousands of sets out in the first year or so in . the worlds oldest annual tennis tournament took place at leamington lawn tennis club in birmingham in . this was three years before the all england lawn tennis and croquet club would hold its first championships at wimbledon in . the first championships culminated in a significant debate on how to standardise the rules.in the u.s. in  mary ewing outerbridge a young socialite returned from bermuda with a sphairistik set. she became fascinated by the game of tennis after watching british army officers play. she laid out a tennis court at the staten island cricket club at camp washington tompkinsville staten island new york. the first american national championship was played there in september . an englishman named o.e. woodhouse won the singles title and a silver cup worth  by defeating canadian i. f. hellmuth. there was also a doubles match which was won by a local pair. there were different rules at each club. the ball in boston was larger than the one normally used in new york.on  may  the oldest nationwide tennis organization in the world was formed the united states national lawn tennis association now the united states tennis association in order to standardize the rules and organize competitions. the u.s. national mens singles championship now the us open was first held in  at the newport casino newport rhode island. the u.s. national womens singles championships were first held in  in philadelphia.tennis also became popular in france where the french championships dates to  although until  it was open only to tennis players who were members of french clubs. thus wimbledon the us open the french open and the australian open dating to  became and have remained the most prestigious events in tennis. together these four events are called the majors or slams a term borrowed from bridge rather than baseball.in  the international lawn tennis federation iltf now the international tennis federation itf was founded and established three official tournaments as the major championships of the day. the world grass court championships were awarded to great britain.  the world hard court championships were awarded to france the term hard court was used for clay courts at the time. some tournaments were held in belgium instead. and the world covered court championships for indoor courts was awarded annually sweden france great britain denmark switzerland and spain each hosted the tournament. at a meeting held on  march  in paris the title world championship was dropped and a new category of official championship was created for events in great britain france the united states and australia  todays grand slam events. the impact on the four recipient nations to replace the world championships with officialchampionships was simple in a general sense each became a major nation of the federation with enhanced voting power and each now operated a major event.the comprehensive rules promulgated in  by the iltf have remained largely stable in the ensuing eighty years the one major change being the addition of the tiebreak system designed by jimmy van alen. that same year tennis withdrew from the olympics after the  games but returned  years later as a andunder demonstration event in . this reinstatement was credited by the efforts by the then itf president philippe chatrier itf general secretary david gray and itf vice president pablo llorens and support from ioc president juan antonio samaranch. the success of the event was overwhelming and the ioc decided to reintroduce tennis as a full medal sport at seoul in .the davis cup an annual competition between mens national teams dates to . the analogous competition for womens national teams the fed cup was founded as the federation cup in  to celebrate the th anniversary of the founding of the itf.in  promoter c. c. pyle established the first professional tennis tour with a group of american and french tennis players playing exhibition matches to paying audiences. the most notable of these early professionals were the american vinnie richards and the frenchwoman suzanne lenglen. once a player turned pro he or she was no longer permitted to compete in the major amateur tournaments.in  commercial pressures and rumors of some amateurs taking money under the table led to the abandonment of this distinction inaugurating the open era in which all players could compete in all tournaments and top players were able to make their living from tennis. with the beginning of the open era the establishment of an international professional tennis circuit and revenues from the sale of television rights tenniss popularity has spread worldwide and the sport has shed its middleclass englishspeaking image although it is acknowledged that this stereotype still exists.in  van alen founded the international tennis hall of fame a nonprofit museum in newport rhode island. the building contains a large collection of tennis memorabilia as well as a hall of fame honouring prominent members and tennis players from all over the world. each year a grass court tournament and an induction ceremony honoring new hall of fame members are hosted on its grounds.part of the appeal of tennis stems from the simplicity of equipment required for play. beginners need only a racket and balls.the components of a tennis racket include a handle known as the grip connected to a neck which joins a roughly elliptical frame that holds a matrix of tightly pulled strings. for the first  years of the modern game rackets were made of wood and of standard size and strings were of animal gut. laminated wood construction yielded more strength in rackets used through most of the th century until first metal and then composites of carbon graphite ceramics and lighter metals such as titanium were introduced. these stronger materials enabled the production of oversized rackets that yielded yet more power. meanwhile technology led to the use of synthetic strings that match the feel of gut yet with added durability.under modern rules of tennis the rackets must adhere to the following guidelinesthe rules regarding rackets have changed over time as material and engineering advances have been made. for example the maximum length of the frame had been  inches cm until  when it was shortened to  inches cm.many companies manufacture and distribute tennis rackets. wilson head and babolat are some of the more commonly used brands however many more companies exist.example  needed the same companies sponsor players to use these rackets in the hopes that the company name will become more well known by the public.tennis balls were originally made of cloth strips stitched together with thread and stuffed with feathers. modern tennis balls are made of hollow vulcanized rubber with a felt coating. traditionally white the predominant colour was gradually changed to optic yellow in the latter part of the th century to allow for improved visibility. tennis balls must conform to certain criteria for size weight deformation and bounce to be approved for regulation play. the international tennis federation itf defines the official diameter as ..mm ..in. balls must weigh between . and .g . and .oz. tennis balls were traditionally manufactured in the united states and europe. although the process of producing the balls has remained virtually unchanged for the past  years the majority of manufacturing now takes place in the far east. the relocation is due to cheaper labour costs and materials in the region. tournaments that are played under the itf rules of tennis must use balls that are approved by the international tennis federation itf and be named on the official itf list of approved tennis balls.advanced players improve their performance through a number of accoutrements. vibration dampeners may be interlaced in the proximal part of the string array for improved feel. racket handles may be customized with absorbent or rubberlike materials to improve the players grip. players often use sweat bands on their wrists to keep their hands dry and head bands or bandanas to keep the sweat out of their eyes as well. finally although the game can be played in a variety of shoes specialized tennis shoes have wide flat soles for stability and a builtup front structure to avoid excess wear.tennis is played on a rectangular flat surface. the court is  feet .m long and  feet .m wide for singles matches and ft m for doubles matches. additional clear space around the court is required in order for players to reach overrun balls. a net is stretched across the full width of the court parallel with the baselines dividing it into two equal ends. it is held up by either a cord or metal cable of diameter no greater than .cm in. the net is feet inches .m high at the posts and  feet .m high in the center. the net posts are  feet .m outside the doubles court on each side or for a singles net  feet .m outside the singles court on each side.the modern tennis court owes its design to major walter clopton wingfield. in  wingfield patented a court much the same as the current one for his stick tennis sphairistike. this template was modified in  to the court design that exists today with markings similar to wingfields version but with the hourglass shape of his court changed to a rectangle.tennis is unusual in that it is played on a variety of surfaces. grass clay and hardcourts of concrete or asphalt topped with acrylic are the most common. occasionally carpet is used for indoor play with hardwood flooring having been historically used. artificial turf courts can also be found.the lines that delineate the width of the court are called the baseline farthest back and the service line middle of the court. the short mark in the center of each baseline is referred to as either the hash mark or the center mark. the outermost lines that make up the length are called the doubles sidelines they are the boundaries for doubles matches. the lines to the inside of the doubles sidelines are the singles sidelines and are the boundaries in singles play. the area between a doubles sideline and the nearest singles sideline is called the doubles alley playable in doubles play. the line that runs across the center of a players side of the court is called the service line because the serve must be delivered into the area between the service line and the net on the receiving side. despite its name this is not where a player legally stands when making a serve.the line dividing the service line in two is called the center line or center service line. the boxes this center line creates are called the service boxes depending on a players position they have to hit the ball into one of these when serving. a ball is out only if none of it has hit the area inside the lines or the line upon its first bounce. all lines are required to be between  and  inches  and mm in width with the exception of the baseline which can be up to  inches mm wide although in practice it is often the same width as the others.the players or teams start on opposite sides of the net. one player is designated the server and the opposing player is the receiver. the choice to be server or receiver in the first game and the choice of ends is decided by a coin toss before the warmup starts. service alternates game by game between the two players or teams. for each point the server starts behind the baseline between the center mark and the sideline. the receiver may start anywhere on their side of the net. when the receiver is ready the server will serve although the receiver must play to the pace of the server.for a service to be legal the ball must travel over the net without touching it into the diagonally opposite service box. if the ball hits the net but lands in the service box this is a let or net service which is void and the server retakes that serve. the player can serve any number of let services in a point and they are always treated as voids and not as faults. a fault is a serve that falls long or wide of the service box or does not clear the net. there is also a foot fault when a players foot touches the baseline or an extension of the center mark before the ball is hit. if the second service after a fault is also a fault the server double faults and the receiver wins the point. however if the serve is in it is considered a legal service.a legal service starts a rally in which the players alternate hitting the ball across the net. a legal return consists of a player hitting the ball so that it falls in the servers court before it has bounced twice or hit any fixtures except the net. a player or team cannot hit the ball twice in a row. the ball must travel over the net into the other players court. a ball that hits the net during a rally is considered a legal return as long as it crosses into the opposite side of the court. the first player or team to fail to make a legal return loses the point. the server then moves to the other side of the service line at the start of a new point.a game consists of a sequence of points played with the same player serving. a game is won by the first player to have won at least four points in total and at least two points more than the opponent. the running score of each game is described in a manner peculiar to tennis scores from zero to three points are described as love   and  respectively. if at least three points have been scored by each player making the players scores equal at  apiece the score is not called out as  but rather as deuce. if at least three points have been scored by each side and a player has one more point than his opponent the score of the game is advantage for the player in the lead. during informal games advantage can also be called ad in or van in when the serving player is ahead and ad out or van out when the receiving player is ahead.the score of a tennis game during play is always read with the serving players score first. in tournament play the chair umpire calls the point count e.g. love after each point. at the end of a game the chair umpire also announces the winner of the game and the overall score.a set consists of a sequence of games played with service alternating between games ending when the count of games won meets certain criteria. typically a player wins a set by winning at least six games and at least two games more than the opponent. if one player has won six games and the opponent five an additional game is played. if the leading player wins that game the player wins the set . if the trailing player wins the game tying the set  a tiebreak is played. a tiebreak played under a separate set of rules allows one player to win one more game and thus the set to give a final set score of . a love set means that the loser of the set won zero games colloquially termed a jam donut in the us. in tournament play the chair umpire announces the winner of the set and the overall score. the final score in sets is always read with the winning players score first e.g.    .a match consists of a sequence of sets. the outcome is determined through a best of three or five sets system. on the professional circuit men play bestoffiveset matches at all four grand slam tournaments davis cup and the final of the olympic games and bestofthreeset matches at all other tournaments while women play bestofthreeset matches at all tournaments. the first player to win two sets in a bestofthree or three sets in a bestoffive wins the match. only in the final sets of matches at the australian open the french open wimbledon the olympic games davis cup until  and fed cup are tiebreaks not played. in these cases sets are played indefinitely until one player has a twogame lead occasionally leading to some remarkably long matches.in tournament play the chair umpire announces the end of the match with the wellknown phrase game set match followed by the winning persons or teams name.a game point occurs in tennis whenever the player who is in the lead in the game needs only one more point to win the game. the terminology is extended to sets set point matches match point and even championships championship point. for example if the player who is serving has a score of love the player has a triple game point triple set point etc. as the player has three consecutive chances to win the game. game points set points and match points are not part of official scoring and are not announced by the chair umpire in tournament play.a break point occurs if the receiver not the server has a chance to win the game with the next point. break points are of particular importance because serving is generally considered advantageous with servers being expected to win games in which they are serving. a receiver who has one score of  or advantage two score of  or three score of love consecutive chances to win the game has break point double break point or triple break point respectively. if the receiver does in fact win their break point the game is awarded to the receiver and the receiver is said to have converted their break point. if the receiver fails to win their break point it is called a failure to convert. winning break points and thus the game is also referred to as breaking serve as the receiver has disrupted or broken the natural advantage of the server. if in the following game the previous server also wins a break point it is referred to as breaking back. except where tiebreaks apply at least one break of serve is required to win a set.another however informal tennis format is called canadian doubles. this involves three players with one person playing a doubles team. the single player gets to utilize the alleys normally reserved only for a doubles team. conversely the doubles team does not use the alleys when executing a shot. the scoring is the same as a regular game. this format is not sanctioned by any official body.australian doubles another informal and unsanctioned form of tennis is played with similar rules to the canadian doubles style only in this version players rotate court position after each game. as such each player plays doubles and singles over the course of a match with the singles player always serving. scoring styles vary but one popular method is to assign a value of  points to each game with the server taking both points if he or she holds serve and the doubles team each taking one if they break serve.wheelchair tennis can be played by ablebodied players as well as people who require a wheelchair for mobility. an extra bounce is permitted. this rule makes it possible to have mixed wheelchair and ablebodied matches. it is possible for a doubles team to consist of a wheelchair player and an ablebodied player referred to as oneup onedown or for a wheelchair player to play against an ablebodied player. in such cases the extra bounce is permitted for the wheelchair users only.in most professional play and some amateur competition there is an officiating head judge or chair umpire usually referred to as the umpire who sits in a raised chair to one side of the court. the umpire has absolute authority to make factual determinations. the umpire may be assisted by line judges who determine whether the ball has landed within the required part of the court and who also call foot faults. there also may be a net judge who determines whether the ball has touched the net during service. the umpire has the right to overrule a line judge or a net judge if the umpire is sure that a clear mistake has been made.in some tournaments line judges who would be calling the serve were assisted by electronic sensors that beeped to indicate the serve was out. this system was called cyclops. cyclops has since largely been replaced by the hawkeye system. in professional tournaments using this system players are allowed three unsuccessful appeals per set plus one additional appeal in the tiebreak to challenge close line calls by means of an electronic review. the us open miami masters us open series and world team tennis started using this challenge system in  and the australian open and wimbledon introduced the system in . in claycourt matches such as at the french open a call may be questioned by reference to the mark left by the balls impact on the court surface.the referee who is usually located off the court is the final authority about tennis rules. when called to the court by a player or team captain the referee may overrule the umpires decision if the tennis rules were violated question of law but may not change the umpires decision on a question of fact. if however the referee is on the court during play the referee may overrule the umpires decision. this would only happen in davis cup or fed cup matches not at the world group level when a chair umpire from a nonneutral country is in the chair.ball boys and girls may be employed to retrieve balls pass them to the players and hand players their towels. they have no adjudicative role. in rare events e.g. if they are hurt or if they have caused a hindrance the umpire may ask them for a statement of what actually happened. the umpire may consider their statements when making a decision. in some leagues especially junior leagues players make their own calls trusting each other to be honest. this is the case for many school and university level matches. the referee or referees assistant however can be called on court at a players request and the referee or assistant may change a players call. in unofficiated matches a ball is out only if the player entitled to make the call is sure that the ball is out.in tennis a junior is a player under  who is still legally protected by a parent or guardian. players on the main adult tour who are under  must have documents signed by a parent or guardian. these players however are still eligible to play in junior tournaments.the international tennis federation itf conducts a junior tour that allows juniors to establish a world ranking and an association of tennis professionals atp or womens tennis association wta ranking. most juniors who enter the international circuit do so by progressing through itf satellite future and challenger tournaments before entering the main circuit. the latter three circuits also have adults competing in them. some juniors however such as australian lleyton hewitt and frenchman gal monfils have catapulted directly from the junior tour to the atp tour by dominating the junior scene or by taking advantage of opportunities given to them to participate in professional tournaments.in  the itf implemented a new rankings scheme to encourage greater participation in doubles by combining two rankings singles and doubles into one combined tally. junior tournaments do not offer prize money except for the grand slam tournaments which are the most prestigious junior events. juniors may earn income from tennis by participating in the future satellite or challenger tours. tournaments are broken up into different tiers offering different amounts of ranking points culminating with grade a.leading juniors are allowed to participate for their nation in the junior fed cup and davis cup competitions. to succeed in tennis often means having to begin playing at a young age. to facilitate and nurture a juniors growth in tennis almost all tennis playing nations have developed a junior development system. juniors develop their play through a range of tournaments on all surfaces accommodating all different standards of play. talented juniors may also receive sponsorships from governing bodies or private institutions.a tennis match is intended to be continuous. because stamina is a relevant factor arbitrary delays are not permitted. in most cases service is required to occur no more than  seconds after the end of the previous point. this is increased to  seconds when the players change ends after every oddnumbered game and a minute break is permitted between sets. other than this breaks are permitted only when forced by events beyond the players control such as rain damaged footwear damaged racket or the need to retrieve an errant ball. should a player be determined to be stalling repeatedly the chair umpire may initially give a warning followed by subsequent penalties of point game and default of the match for the player who is consistently taking longer than the allowed time limit.in the event of a rain delay darkness or other external conditions halting play the match is resumed at a later time with the same score as at the time of the delay and the players at the same end of the court when rain halted play or at the same position north or south if play is resumed on a different court.balls wear out quickly in serious play and therefore in atp and wta tournaments they are changed after every nine games with the first change occurring after only seven games because the first set of balls is also used for the prematch warmup. as a courtesy to the receiver the server will often signal to the receiver before the first serve of the game in which new balls are used as a reminder that they are using new balls. however in itf tournaments like fed cup the balls are changed in a  style. continuity of the balls condition is considered part of the game so if a rewarmup is required after an extended break in play usually due to rain then the rewarmup is done using a separate set of balls and use of the match balls is resumed only when play resumes.a recent rule change is to allow coaching on court on a limited basis during a match. this has been introduced in womens tennis for wta tour events in  and allows the player to request her coach once per set.a competent tennis player has eight basic shots in his or her repertoire the serve forehand backhand volley halfvolley overhead smash drop shot and lob.a grip is a way of holding the racket in order to hit shots during a match. the grip affects the angle of the racket face when it hits the ball and influences the pace spin and placement of the shot. players use various grips during play including the continental the handshake grip eastern can be either semieastern or full eastern. usually used for backhands. and western semiwestern or full western usually for forehand grips grips. most players change grips during a match depending on what shot they are hitting for example slice shots and serves call for a continental grip.a serve or more formally a service in tennis is a shot to start a point. the serve is initiated by tossing the ball into the air and hitting it usually near the apex of its trajectory into the diagonally opposite service box without touching the net. the serve may be hit under or overhand although underhand serving remains a rarity. if the ball hits the net on the first serve and bounces over into the correct diagonal box then it is called a let and the server gets two more additional serves to get it in. there can also be a let if the server serves the ball and the receiver isnt prepared. if the server misses his or her first serve and gets a let on the second serve then they get one more try to get the serve in the box.experienced players strive to master the conventional overhand serve to maximize its power and placement. the server may employ different types of serve including flat serve topspin serve slice serve and kick american twist serve. a reverse type of spin serve is hit in a manner that spins the ball opposite the natural spin of the server the spin direction depending upon right or lefthandedness. if the ball is spinning counterclockwise it will curve right from the hitters point of view and curve left if spinning clockwise.some servers are content to use the serve simply to initiate the point however advanced players often try to hit a winning shot with their serve. a winning serve that is not touched by the opponent is called an ace.for a righthanded player the forehand is a stroke that begins on the right side of the body continues across the body as contact is made with the ball and ends on the left side of the body. there are various grips for executing the forehand and their popularity has fluctuated over the years. the most important ones are the continental the eastern the semiwestern and the western. for a number of years the small frail s player bill johnston was considered by many to have had the best forehand of all time a stroke that he hit shoulderhigh using a western grip. few top players used the western grip after the s but in the latter part of the th century as shotmaking techniques and equipment changed radically the western forehand made a strong comeback and is now used by many modern players. no matter which grip is used most forehands are generally executed with one hand holding the racket but there have been fine players with twohanded forehands. in the s and s the ecuadorianamerican player pancho segura used a twohanded forehand to achieve a devastating effect against larger more powerful players. players such as monica seles or frances fabrice santoro and marion bartoli are also notable players known for their twohanded forehands.for righthanded players the backhand is a stroke that begins on the left side of their body continues across their body as contact is made with the ball and ends on the right side of their body. it can be executed with either one hand or with both and is generally considered more difficult to master than the forehand. for most of the th century the backhand was performed with one hand using either an eastern or a continental grip. the first notable players to use two hands were the s australians vivian mcgrath and john bromwich but they were lonely exceptions. the twohanded grip gained popularity in the s as bjrn borg chris evert jimmy connors and later mats wilander and marat safin used it to great effect and it is now used by a large number of the worlds best players including rafael nadal and serena williams.two hands give the player more control while one hand can generate a slice shot applying backspin on the ball to produce a low trajectory bounce. reach is also limited with the twohanded shot. the player long considered to have had the best backhand of all time don budge had a powerful onehanded stroke in the s and s that imparted topspin onto the ball. ken rosewall another player noted for his onehanded backhand used a very accurate slice backhand through the s and s. a small number of players notably monica seles use two hands on both the backhand and forehand sides.a volley is a shot returned to the opponent in midair before the ball bounces generally performed near the net and is usually made with a stiffwristed punching motion to hit the ball into an open area of the opponents court. the half volley is made by hitting the ball on the rise just after it has bounced also generally in the vicinity of the net and played with the racket close to the ground. the swinging volley is hit out of the air as the player approaches the net. it is an offensive shot used to take preparation time away from the opponent as it returns the ball into the opponents court much faster than a standard volley.from a poor defensive position on the baseline the lob can be used as either an offensive or defensive weapon hitting the ball high and deep into the opponents court to either enable the lobber to get into better defensive position or to win the point outright by hitting it over the opponents head. if the lob is not hit deeply enough into the other court however an opponent near the net may then hit an overhead smash a hard servelike shot to try to end the point.a difficult shot in tennis is the return of an attempted lob over the backhand side of a player. when the contact point is higher than the reach of a twohanded backhand most players will try to execute a high slice under the ball or sideways. fewer players attempt the backhand skyhook or smash. rarely a player will go for a high topspin backhand while themselves in the air. a successful execution of any of these alternatives requires balance and timing with less margin of error than the lower contact point backhands since this shot is a break in the regular pattern of play.if an opponent is deep in his court a player may suddenly employ an unexpected drop shot by softly tapping the ball just over the net so that the opponent is unable to run in fast enough to retrieve it. advanced players will often apply back spin to a drop shot causing the ball to skid upon landing and bounce sideways with less forward momentum toward their opponent or even backwards towards the net thus making it even more difficult to return.muscle strain is one of the most common injuries in tennis. when an isolated largeenergy appears during the muscle contraction and at the same time body weight apply huge amount of pressure to the lengthened muscle muscle strain can occur. inflammation and bleeding are triggered when muscle strain occurs which can result in redness pain and swelling. overuse is also common in tennis players of all levels. muscle cartilage nerves bursae ligaments and tendons may be damaged from overuse. the repetitive use of a particular muscle without time for repair and recovery is the most common cause of injury.tournaments are often organized by gender and number of players. common tournament configurations include mens singles womens singles and doubles where two players play on each side of the net. tournaments may be organized for specific age groups with upper age limits for youth and lower age limits for senior players. example of this include the orange bowl and les petits as junior tournaments. there are also tournaments for players with disabilities such as wheelchair tennis and deaf tennis. in the four grand slam tournaments the singles draws are limited to  players for each gender.most large tournaments seed players but players may also be matched by their skill level. according to how well a person does in sanctioned play a player is given a rating that is adjusted periodically to maintain competitive matches. for example the united states tennis association administers the national tennis rating program ntrp which rates players between . and . in  point increments. average club players under this system would rate .. while world class players would be . on this scale.the four grand slam tournaments are considered to be the most prestigious tennis events in the world. they are held annually and comprise in chronological order the australian open the french open wimbledon and the us open. apart from the olympic games davis cup fed cup and hopman cup they are the only tournaments regulated by the international tennis federation itf. the itfs national associations tennis australia australian open the fdration franaise de tennis french open the lawn tennis association wimbledon and the united states tennis association us open are delegated the responsibility to organize these events.aside from the historical significance of these events they also carry larger prize funds than any other tour event and are worth double the number of ranking points to the champion than in the next echelon of tournaments the masters  men and premier events women. another distinguishing feature is the number of players in the singles draw. there are  more than any other professional tennis tournament. this draw is composed of  seeded players other players ranked in the worlds top  qualifiers and players who receive invitations through wild cards. grand slam mens tournaments have bestoffive set matches while the women play bestofthree. grand slam tournaments are among the small number of events that last two weeks the others being the indian wells masters and the miami masters.currently the grand slam tournaments are the only tour events that have mixed doubles contests. grand slam tournaments are held in conjunction with wheelchair tennis tournaments and junior tennis competitions. these tournaments also contain their own idiosyncrasies. for example players at wimbledon are required to wear predominantly white. andre agassi chose to skip wimbledon from  through  citing the events traditionalism particularly its predominantly white dress code. wimbledon has its own particular methods for disseminating tickets often leading tennis fans to follow complex procedures to obtain tickets. the international tournament began in the atp world tour masters  is a group of nine tournaments that form the secondhighest echelon in mens tennis. each event is held annually and a win at one of these events is worth  ranking points. when the atp led by hamilton jordan began running the mens tour in  the directors designated the top nine tournaments outside of the grand slam events as super  events. in  this became the tennis masters series and in  the atp masters series. in november at the end of the tennis year the worlds top eight players compete in the atp world tour finals a tournament with a rotating locale. it is currently held in london england.in august  the atp announced major changes to the tour that were introduced in . the masters series was renamed to the masters  the addition of the number  referring to the number of ranking points earned by the winner of each tournament. contrary to earlier plans the number of tournaments was not reduced from nine to eight and the monte carlo masters remains part of the series although unlike the other events it does not have a mandatory player commitment. the hamburg masters has been downgraded to a point event. the madrid masters moved to may and onto clay courts and a new tournament in shanghai took over madrids former indoor october slot. as of  six of the nine  level tournaments are combined atp and wta events.the third and fourth tier of mens tennis tournaments are formed by the atp world tour  series consisting of  tournaments and the atp world tour  series with  tournaments. like the atp world tour masters  these events offer various amounts of prize money and the numbers refer to the amount of ranking points earned by the winner of a tournament. the dubai tennis championships offer the largest financial incentive to players with total prize money of us . these series have various draws of    and  for singles and  and  for doubles. it is mandatory for leading players to enter at least four  events including at least one after the us open.the challenger tour for men is the lowest level of tournament administered by the atp. it is composed of about  events and as a result features a more diverse range of countries hosting events. the majority of players use the challenger series at the beginning of their career to work their way up the rankings. andre agassi between winning grand slam tournaments plummeted to world no.  and used challenger series events for match experience and to progress back up the rankings. the challenger series offers prize funds of between us and us.below the challenger tour are the futures tournaments events on the itf mens circuit. these tournaments also contribute towards a players atp rankings points. futures tournaments offer prize funds of between us and us. approximately  futures tournaments are played each year.premier events for women form the most prestigious level of events on the womens tennis association tour after the grand slam tournaments. these events offer the largest rewards in terms of points and prize money. within the premier category are premier mandatory premier  and premier tournaments. the premier events were introduced in  replacing the previous tier i and ii tournament categories. currently four tournaments are premier mandatory five tournaments are premier  and twelve tournaments are premier. the first tiering system in womens tennis was introduced in . at the time of its creation only two tournaments the lipton international players championships in florida and the german open in berlin comprised the tier i category.international tournaments are the second main tier of the wta tour and consist of  tournaments with a prize money for every event at u.s. except for the yearending commonwealth bank tournament of champions in bali which has prize money of u.s..professional tennis players enjoy the same relative perks as most top sports personalities clothing equipment and endorsements. like players of other individual sports such as golf they are not salaried but must play and finish highly in tournaments to obtain prize money.in recent years some controversy has surrounded the involuntary or deliberate noise caused by players grunting.while players are gradually less competitive in singles by their late s and early s they can still continue competitively in doubles as instanced by martina navratilova and john mcenroe who won doubles titles in their s.in the open era several female players such as martina navratilova margaret court martina hingis serena williams and venus williams the latter two sisters playing together have been prolific at both singles and doubles events throughout their careers. john mcenroe is one of the very few professional male players to be top ranked in both singles and doubles at the same time and yevgeny kafelnikov is the most recent male player to win multiple grand slams in both singles and doubles during the same period of his career.  in terms of public attention and earnings see below singles champions have far surpassed their doubles counterparts. the open era particularly the mens side has seen many topranked singles players that only sparingly compete in doubles while having doubles specialists who are typically being eliminated early in the singles draw but do well in the doubles portion of a tournament. notable doubles pairings include the woodies todd woodbridge and mark woodforde and the bryan brothers identical twin brothers robert charles bob bryan and michael carl mike bryan. woodbridge has disliked the term doubles specialists saying that he and woodforde set a singles schedule and doubles fitted in around that although later in woodbridges career he focused exclusively on doubles as his singles ranking fell too low that it was no longer financially viable to recover at that age. woodbridge noted that while top singles players earn enough that they dont need to nor want to play doubles he suggested that lowerranked singles players outside the top ten should play doubles to earn more playing time and money.the olympics doubles tennis tournament necessitates that both members of a doubles pairing be from the same country hence several top professional pairs such as jamie murray and bruno soares cannot compete in the olympics. topranked singles players that are usually rivals on the professional circuit such as boris becker and michael stich and roger federer and stan wawrinka have formed a rare doubles partnership for the olympics. unlike professional tennis tournaments see below where singles players receive much more prize money than doubles players an olympic medal for both singles and doubles has similar prestige. the olympics is more of a priority for doubles champions while singles champions often skip the tournament. while the atp has voted for olympic results to count towards player ranking points wta players voted against it.for the  olympics lisa raymond was passed over for team usa in favor of serena williams by captain billie jean king even though raymond was the topranked doubles player in the world at the time and raymond unsuccessfully challenged the selection.in professional tennis tournaments such as wimbledon the singles competition receives the most prize money and coverage followed by doubles and then mixed doubles usually receive the lowest monetary awards. for instance in the us open as of  the mens and womens singles prize money us accounts for . percent of total player base compensation while mens and womens doubles us mens and womens singles qualifying us and mixed doubles us account for . percent . percent and . percent respectively. the singles winner receives us while the doubles winning pair receives  and the mixed doubles winning pair receives us.the following players have won at least five singles titles at grand slam tournamentsa frequent topic of discussion among tennis fans and commentators is who was the greatest male singles player of all time. by a large margin an associated press poll in  named bill tilden as the greatest player of the first half of the th century. from  to  tilden won singles titles at wimbledon three times and the u.s. championships seven times. in  however donald budge became the first person to win all four major singles titles during the same calendar year the grand slam and won six consecutive major titles in  and . tilden called budge the finest player  days a year that ever lived. in his  autobiography jack kramer said that based on consistent play budge was the greatest player ever. some observers however also felt that kramer deserved consideration for the title. kramer was among the few who dominated amateur and professional tennis during the late s and early s. tony trabert has said that of the players he saw before the start of the open era kramer was the best male champion.by the s budge and others had added pancho gonzales and lew hoad to the list of contenders. budge reportedly believed that gonzales was the greatest player ever. gonzales said about hoad when lews game was at its peak nobody could touch him.... i think his game was the best game ever. better than mine. he was capable of making more shots than anybody. his two volleys were great. his overhead was enormous. he had the most natural tennis mind with the most natural tennis physique.before and during the open era rod laver remains the only male player in history to have won the calendar year grand slam twice in  and   and also the calendar year professional grand slam in . more recently bjrn borg and pete sampras were regarded by many of their contemporaries as among the greatest ever. andre agassi the first of two male players in history to have achieved a career golden slam in singles tennis followed by rafael nadal has been called the best service returner in the history of the game. he is the first man to win grand slams on all modern surfaces previous holders of all grand slam tournaments played in an era of grass and clay only and is regarded by a number of critics and fellow players to be among the greatest players of all time. however it must be noted that both rod laver and ken rosewall also won major pro slam tournaments on all three surfaces grass clay wood rosewall in  and laver in .more recently roger federer is considered by many observers to have the most complete game in modern tennis. he has won  grand slam titles and  world tour finals the most for any male player. many experts of tennis former tennis players and his own tennis peers believe federer is the greatest player in the history of the game. federers biggest rival rafael nadal is regarded as the greatest competitor in tennis history by some former players and is regarded to have the potential to be the greatest of all time. nadal is regarded as the greatest clay court player of all time.as with the men there are frequent discussions about who is the greatest female singles player of all time with steffi graf martina navratilova and serena williams being the three players most often nominated.in march  the tennischannel published a combined list of the  greatest men and women tennis players of all time. it ranked steffi graf as the greatest female player in rd place overall followed by martina navratilova th place and margaret court th place. the rankings were determined by an international panel.sportswriter john wertheim of sports illustrated stated in an article in july  that serena williams is the greatest female tennis player ever with the argument that headtohead on a neutral surface i.e. hard courts everyone at their best i cant help feeling that she crushes the other legends.. in a reaction to this article yahoo sports blog busted racket published a list of the top womens tennis players of all time placing martina navratilova in first spot. this top list was similar to the one published in june  by the bleacher report who also ranked martina navratilova as the top female player of all time.steffi graf is considered by some to be the greatest female player. billie jean king said in  steffi is definitely the greatest womens tennis player of all time. martina navratilova has included graf on her list of great players. in december  graf was named the greatest female tennis player of the th century by a panel of experts assembled by the associated press. tennis writer steve flink in his book the greatest tennis matches of the twentieth century named her as the best female player of the th century directly followed by martina navratilova.tennis magazine selected martina navratilova as the greatest female tennis player for the years  through . tennis historian and journalist bud collins has called navratilova arguably the greatest player of all time. billie jean king said about navratilova in  shes the greatest singles doubles and mixed doubles player whos ever lived.\n"
