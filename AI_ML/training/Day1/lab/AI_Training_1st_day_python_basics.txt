Write program to Median package


Numpy is written c ( Numerical python )
 similar functions in tenserflow (runs GPU) and 
 
 GPU has parellel processes can be used for training your data and faster computation and production level code will run on CPUs
 
 GPUs are much cost expensive when compared to CPUs in terms of multiple processes
 
 multi dimensional arrays are called tensers and hence name tenserflow
 
 Numpy is enough for doing ML and Data science
 
 below are written in Numpy
 
 
 
 Statistics
 
 array A 
 
 Law of Large Numbers
 
 Random Variables
 
 
 Discrete   :  finate or countable number of values  = answer never will be precision 
 Continuous :  fiding temperatures in a room is ( 23.2 ) = whose values have fractions 
 
 Probability Mass Function 
 
 Function which has Discrete data and their sum will be 1
 
 
 Bernoulli Distribution
 
 experiment which has only 2 outputs.
 
 probability of 1 event is p(1)
 probability of 2nd event is 1-p(1)
 
 Binomial Distributoin Definition
 
 m= number of trails
 
 non-negative integer values
 
 p[X=x] = n        x    n-x  : x=0,1,2, 3, ...n   
            c    P    q
              x       0 ; else where
              
              
 A police fires 6 bullets on a dacoit. the pro that the dcoit will be killed by a bullet is 0.3
 
 what is the probability that the dacoit is still avalive
 
 1 :  0.3 
 
 nCr = n! / r! * (n - r)!

 Problems:
 
 np.random.binomial(5, 0.2, size=10)
 
 
 the chance of attendance of coming tommorrow is 90% and total we have 18 people , attendance greather >=16
 
 print( binomial(18,16,0.9)+ binomial(18,17,0.9)+ binomial(18,17,0.9));
 
 1 per day 5 cigra
 chance of less 3 
 
 if we don't know n in binomial then we don't use that instead of we use Poisson Distribution
 
 Poison Distribution [ Number of trails are pretty large ]
 
 How many maruthis are going in each day in this road
 
 here n we don't know
 
 it is subset of binomial technique , it helps ' n is abstract ' = n is infinate
 
 p(x) = p(X=x) =  e \
 
 3=2.72
 
 
 if the probability that an individual suffers a bad reaction from an injection of  a given serum is 0.0001, 
 determine the probability that out of 500 individuals
 n=500
 p =0.001
 
 exactly = 3
 morethan 2 individuals suffer from bad reaction 
 
 
Average n times p

A tea vendor sells 20(lamda) cups per hour
what is probability he sells more than 25 cups of tea per
