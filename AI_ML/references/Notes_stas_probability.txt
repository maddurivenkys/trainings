Notes on Stats and Probability

Mutually exclusive means the events cannot both occur.
For example, if i'm deciding which dress to wear to an event, that's a mutually exclusive decision. 
I cannot wear both dresses; I must choose one. 

Mutually inclusive means the events cannot occur independently.

If I want to roll a die to get a number 6, the number 1 will be in the bottom.
One can't happen without the other. These are mutually inclusive

They're opposites. " mutually exclusive" means you cna't have both at once;
if A is true, then B is false.
For example, if Trump is elected, then Clinton can't be - they're mutually exclusive.

Mutually inclusive, means you can't have one without the other, 
if A is true , then B is true. For example, if I'm married to my wife. then she's married to me.
